        <p class="quotes">“Why would I want to have 10 Ferraris, 20 watches with diamonds and two aeroplanes? I’ve been hungry. I had to work in the fields. I played football barefoot. But today, with what I earn through football, I can help my people. I prefer that my people receive a little of what life has given me.”</p>
        <p>Sadio Mané (born 10 April 1992) is a Senegalese professional footballer who plays as a winger for Premier League club Liverpool and the Senegal national team. Mané finished fourth for the 2019 Ballon d'Or, and in the award for the Best FIFA Men's Player he ranked fifth in 2019 and fourth in 2020.</p>
        <p>Despite his fame and wealth, Mane clearly hasn’t forgotten his roots.

          The 29-year-old is well aware of the poverty-stricken conditions in his home village of Bambaly and paid for a hospital to be built there.

          Mane then donated £250,000 to fund a new secondary school and was spotted visiting the construction site to check on its progress.

          During the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, he personally paid for 50 Senegalese fans to fly to Cameroon and watch their semi-final victory. Mane’s personality has helped him to become a favourite with Liverpool supporters, while even rival fans may find it difficult to dislike him.</p>
